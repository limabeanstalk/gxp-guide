Welcome to **GxP Guide**, a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer questions about regulatory compliance guidelines for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing (e.g.,21 CFR Part 11) using:
- Local embeddings (SentenceTransformers)
- MongoDB for vector storage
- A local LLM (TinyLlama)
- A Streamlit UI for interactive querying

This project demonstrates a full end‑to‑end RAG pipeline, including:
- Document ingestion
- Cleaning and normalization
- Chunking
- Embedding generation
- Vector search
- Context assembly
- LLM answer generation
- A browser-based UI
